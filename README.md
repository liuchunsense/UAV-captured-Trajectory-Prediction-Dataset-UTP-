# UAV-captured-Trajectory-Prediction-Dataset-UTP

In this study, we build and release a video dataset for trajectory prediction problem in complex crossroads, named UAV-captured Trajectory Prediction Dataset (UTP-Dataset), containing 5,840 videos with more than 2,500 pedestrians and 2,700 vehicles. This dataset can be used for the different researches in Vehicle to Everything (V2X), traffic supervision and command, pattern recognition and computer vision, etc.

## What is UTP?

#UAV-captured Trajectory Prediction Dataset (UTP-dataset)
	In this study, we build and release a video dataset for trajectory prediction problem in complex crossroads, named UAV-captured Trajectory Prediction Dataset (UTP-Dataset), containing 5,840 videos with more than 2,500 pedestrians and 2,700 vehicles. This dataset can be used for the different researches in Vehicle to Everything (V2X), traffic supervision and command, pattern recognition and computer vision, etc.

  The data acquisition device is the four-rotor DJI Matrice 200 with a Zenmuse X5S gimbal camera, which can shoot high-definition video with a resolution of $3840 \times 2160$ at a speed of $30$ FPS (frames per second). Different intersections with different structures and different traffic densities are selected as the capture sites. The diverse scenes captured by drones include urban traffic scenes such as large square intersections, small square intersections, rectangular intersections and T-shaped intersections. The situations are complex and changeable, and with different traffic participants including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, reflecting rich and diverse interactive information. Fig. 1 shows some samples of UTP-Dataset.
