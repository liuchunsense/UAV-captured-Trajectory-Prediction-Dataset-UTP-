In this study, we build and release a video dataset for trajectory prediction problem in complex crossroads, named \emph{UAV-captured Trajectory Prediction Dataset} (UTP-Dataset), containing 5,840 videos with more than 2,500 pedestrians and 2,700 vehicles. This dataset can be used for the different researches in Vehicle to Everything (V2X), traffic supervision and command, pattern recognition and computer vision, etc.
